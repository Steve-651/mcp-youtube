# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a TypeScript MCP (Minimal Communication Protocol) server designed to download YouTube videos and provide utilities for AI understanding of content, including metadata and transcriptions.

**Important Note**: The current implementation appears to be a basic Express/Socket.IO server starter template rather than an actual MCP server. The package.json indicates MCP SDK dependency, but the server.ts file implements a standard HTTP/WebSocket server.

## Development Commands

- `npm run build` - Compile TypeScript to JavaScript in dist/ directory
- `npm start` - Run the compiled server from dist/server.js
- `npm run debug` - Start server with Node.js inspector for debugging

## Architecture

### File Structure
- `src/server.ts` - Main server entry point (currently Express/Socket.IO, not MCP)
- `src/types/index.ts` - TypeScript interfaces for MCP protocol structures
- `dist/` - Compiled JavaScript output (generated by build)

### Key Architecture Notes
- TypeScript compilation target: ES6, CommonJS modules
- Server currently runs on port 3000 (configurable via PORT env var)
- Uses @modelcontextprotocol/sdk dependency but not yet implemented
- Types defined for MCP protocol: MCPRequest, MCPResponse, MCPError, MCPNotification

### Development Workflow
1. Make changes in src/
2. Run `npm run build` to compile
3. Run `npm start` to test changes
4. Use `npm run debug` for debugging with Node.js inspector

## Important Context

The project appears to be in early development - the server implementation doesn't match the MCP server description in the README. The actual MCP protocol implementation using @modelcontextprotocol/sdk needs to be developed to replace the current Express/Socket.IO setup.
